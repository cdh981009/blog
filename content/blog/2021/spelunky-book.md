최근에 평소 읽고 싶었던 스펠렁키 책을 읽게 되었다.

# brainstorm

1. 게임개발자를 하고싶은 사람으로써 "옳은 방식"으로 게임을 만들어야 한다는 강박을 가진다던가, 이렇게 성공한 사람도 나와 같은 고민을 하던 시절이 있었다는 사실이 좋았다.
2. 내가 평소에 막연하게 가지고 있던 생각을 글로 잘 표현해 놓아 좋았다. (게이머들이 편한 경험을 추구함에 따른 단점들)
3. 다시시작하면 훨씬 잘 할 수 있을 것 같다는 유혹에 넘어가지 말고 끝내는것이 중요하다는 말에 크게 공감했다. 이번에 블로그를 만들면서도 점점 코드가 더러워지자 다시하고싶다는 충동이 매번 강하게 들었지만 이 책의 내용을 따라서 일단 밀고가기로 했다. 완벽주의자적인 성향이 내게 스트레스를 안겨준 경험이 너무 많다.

> &emsp;I've tried programming a game engine from scratch before, surrounding myself with books like *Tricks of the Game-Programming Gurus* in an effort to "make games the right way," but when days of work yield as much as I could make in Game Maker in a few minutes, it's hard to stay motivated.

> &emsp;I accepted that I wasn't cut out for academia and programming theory. (. . .) This important realization meant I could stop wasting my time trying to be something I wasn't. Instead of being embarrassed about not being a "real programmer" using "real programming languages," I vowed to make games whichever way felt good to *me*.

> &emsp;My worry is that as players we've grown too comfortable with being comfortable. (. . .) We've gone from asking, "How does this game play?" to asking, "Does this game play the way I want to play?"

> &emsp;We can't have everything that we want all at once, though. We can't know what to expect and also be surprised. We can't be free from frustration and also be challenged. We can't go unchallenged and also feel satisfied with our accomplishments.

> &emsp;At some point in any project, you will look back on everything you've done and feel like you could do it all better. Perhaps the code seems like a tangled mess. (. . .) They obviously learned a lot from reiterating on the same early sections, but they never learned how to navigate that wasteland or overcome that consummate destroyer of dreams: being too much of a perfectionist.
